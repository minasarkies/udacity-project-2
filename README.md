# Udacity: Build A Storefront Backend
#### Summary

> The company's stakeholders have decided that they want to create an online store where their product ideas can be purchased â€“ and they want me and a coworker to build it.
> The stakeholders have compiled a list of prerequisites for this online store. My coworker will build the frontend, while I will `provide the backend`, and the requirements have been compiled into a requirements document.
> I'll `build the database`, including tables and columns, to meet the data requirements, and then `write a RESTful API` to expose that information to the frontend developer.
> In order to be ready for beta testing, my application needs to `have tests`, `secure user information`, and `provide user authentication tokens` that are ready to integrate with the frontend.

The database schema and and API route information can be found in the [REQUIREMENT.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)

- In psql run the following to create a user 
    - `CREATE USER shopping_user WITH PASSWORD 'password123';`
- In psql run the following to create the dev and test database
    - `CREATE DATABASE shopping;`
    - `CREATE DATABASE shopping_test;`
- Connect to the databases and grant all privileges
    - Grant for dev database
        - `\c shopping`
        - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE shopping TO shopping_user;`
    - Grant for test database
        - `\c shopping_test`
        - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE shopping_test TO shopping_user;`
